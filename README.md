# Ka-Kha-Bank-PLC ATM Simulator System

# Project History
Welcome to the Ka-Kha-Bank-PLC ATM Simulator System! This project was created to provide a comprehensive simulation of an ATM system using Java (version 21), MySQL for database management, and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The inspiration for this project came from a desire to understand and implement the core functionalities of an ATM system, which is an integral part of modern banking. The aim was to create a realistic simulation that mimics the operations of an ATM, allowing users to perform essential banking transactions.


# Development Journey
The development journey began with a focus on the core features of an ATM:
  1. User Authentication: Implementing secure login and logout functionalities to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
  2. Account Management: Allowing new users to register and create accounts within the system.
  3. Transactions: Enabling users to perform various transactions such as adding cash, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and withdrawing the first cash of the day.
  4. Security: Providing a feature to change the PIN, enhancing the security of user accounts.
  5. Transaction History: Offering a mini statement feature to view recent transactions, helping users keep track of their financial activities.
   
# Key Features
  1. Login & Logout: Secure user authentication to protect user data.
  2. Account Registration: Simple and straight forward account creation process.
  3. Cash Management: Functions to add, withdraw, and deposit cash seamlessly.
  4. Change PIN: An easy way for users to update their security credentials.
  5. Mini Statement: Quick access to recent transaction history for user convenience.
   
# Technical Stack
  1. Java (version 21): The core programming language used for developing the application, leveraging its robust and versatile capabilities.
  2. Swing: The Java-based GUI toolkit used to create a user-friendly and intuitive graphical interface for the ATM simulator.
