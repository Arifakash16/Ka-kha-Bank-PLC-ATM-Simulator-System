# Ka-Kha-Bank-PLC ATM Simulator System

# Project History

Welcome to the Ka-Kha-Bank-PLC ATM Simulator System! This project was created to provide a comprehensive simulation of an ATM system using Java (version 17), MySQL for database management, and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI).
The inspiration for this project came from a desire to understand and implement the core functionalities of an ATM system, which is an integral part of modern banking. The aim was to create a realistic simulation that mimics the operations of an ATM, allowing users to perform essential banking transactions.
